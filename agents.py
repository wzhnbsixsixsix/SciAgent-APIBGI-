Given some key concepts extracted from a comprehensive knowledge graph, your task is to define each one of the terms and discuss the relationships identified in the graph.

The format of the knowledge graph is "node_1 -- relationship between node_1 and node_2 -- node_2 -- relationship between node_2 and node_3 -- node_3...."

Make sure to incorporate EACH of the concepts in the knowledge graph in your response.

Do not add any introductory phrases. First, define each term in the knowledge graph and then, secondly, discuss each of the relationships, with context.

Here is an example structure for our response, in the following format

{{
### Definitions:
A clear definition of each term in the knowledge graph.
### Relationships
A thorough discussion of all the relationships in the graph. 
}}

Perform only the tasks assigned to you in the plan; do not undertake tasks assigned to other agents. Additionally, do not execute any functions or tools.

Given the definitions and relationships acquired from a comprehensive knowledge graph, your task is to synthesize a novel research proposal with initial key aspects-hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design_principles, unexpected_properties, comparision, and novelty  . Your response should not only demonstrate deep understanding and rational thinking but also explore imaginative and unconventional applications of these concepts. 
    
Analyze the graph deeply and carefully, then craft a detailed research proposal that investigates a likely groundbreaking aspect that incorporates EACH of the concepts and relationships identified in the knowledge graph by the ontologist.

Consider the implications of your proposal and predict the outcome or behavior that might result from this line of investigation. Your creativity in linking these concepts to address unsolved problems or propose new, unexplored areas of study, emergent or unexpected behaviors, will be highly valued.

Be as quantitative as possible and include details such as numbers, sequences, or chemical formulas. 

Your response should include the following SEVEN keys in great detail: 

"hypothesis" clearly delineates the hypothesis at the basis for the proposed research question. The hypothesis should be well-defined, has novelty, is feasible, has a well-defined purpose and clear components. Your hypothesis should be as detailed as possible.

"outcome" describes the expected findings or impact of the research. Be quantitative and include numbers, material properties, sequences, or chemical formula.

"mechanisms" provides details about anticipated chemical, biological or physical behaviors. Be as specific as possible, across all scales from molecular to macroscale.

"design_principles" should list out detailed design principles, focused on novel concepts, and include a high level of detail. Be creative and give this a lot of thought, and be exhaustive in your response. 

"unexpected_properties" should predict unexpected properties of the new material or system. Include specific predictions, and explain the rationale behind these clearly using logic and reasoning. Think carefully.

"comparison" should provide a detailed comparison with other materials, technologies or scientific concepts. Be detailed and quantitative. 

"novelty" should discuss novel aspects of the proposed idea, specifically highlighting how this advances over existing knowledge and technology. 

Ensure your scientific proposal is both innovative and grounded in logical reasoning, capable of advancing our understanding or application of the concepts provided.

Here is an example structure for your response, in the following order:

{{
  "1- hypothesis": "...",
  "2- outcome": "...",
  "3- mechanisms": "...",
  "4- design_principles": "...",
  "5- unexpected_properties": "...",
  "6- comparison": "...",
  "7- novelty": "...",

Remember, the value of your response lies in scientific discovery, new avenues of scientific inquiry, and potential technological breakthroughs, with detailed and solid reasoning.

Further Instructions: 
Make sure to incorporate EACH of the concepts in the knowledge graph in your response. 
Perform only the tasks assigned to you in the plan; do not undertake tasks assigned to other agents.
Additionally, do not execute any functions or tools.
